# SAFMEDS

## About SAFMEDS

SAFMEDS is a humble flashcard application.
Its use is intended for research and general knowledge building. 

It was initially built with HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, and Php. 
It was ported over to the Laravel framework for server-side rendering and other capabilities.

I learned routing inside [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/routing#route-parameters), semantic structuring of elements in [HTML 5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp), the inline-block layout in [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_inline-block.asp), useful array methods in [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp), and much more.
