## About SAFMEDS

SAFMEDS is a humble flashcard application that you can use at your leisure.
I built this project with the help of several technologies as part of a school intro web development class.
Its use is intended for research and general knowledge building. 
It was initially built with HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, and Php. 
It was ported over to the Laravel framework for server-side rendering and other capabilities.

I learned a variety of technologies, including but not liimited to, Routing inside [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/routing#route-parameters), Semantic structuring of elements in [HTML 5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp), the Inline-Block layout in [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_inline-block.asp), and useful array methods in [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp).
